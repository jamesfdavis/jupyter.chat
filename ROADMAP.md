# Jupyter.Chat Roadmap

Jupyter Chatbot aims to be a framework that analyzes Obsidian Graph data and ports those connections into a chat knowledgebase. Workflows may include parameterized call-outs to Jupyter Notebooks to return complex answers.

This roadmap represents some of the priorities for the project over the next few months. Issues or pull requests may be opened to discuss each of these items as they progress.

## Initiate the project.
- [ ] Establish shell to run chat-flow.

## Establish testing suite.

## Generate example worflows.
